                    In order to maintain integrity of the Service, Codebell must take measures to avoid creation of
                    accounts by spammers. Each User Account is unique and associated with an individual. Therefore, a
                    unique identifier is generated and associated with each user. Contact number is used to facilitate
                    messaging service between one or more users of the service. The legal basis for processing is User
                    Consent. You are free to delete your User Account and remove that data in the account panel of your

                    information related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your User Account, to
                    verify your User Account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may
                    also inform you about new Codebell features in which you might have an interest. You are free, at
                    any given time, to opt-out of those features through the account settings panel. In order to pursue
                    our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers,
                    Codebell uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be asked to verify using either
                    reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved
                    temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer.

                    We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are instructed to do so by a fully
                    binding request coming from the competent authorities (legal obligation). While we may comply with
                    electronically delivered notices (see exceptions below), the disclosed data can only be used in
                    court after we have received an original copy of the court order by registered post or in person,
                    and provide a formal response.

                    Codebell may from time to time, contest requests if there is a public interest in doing so. In such
                    situations, the Company will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been
                    exhausted.
